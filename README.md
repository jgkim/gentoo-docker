# What is Gentoo?

Gentoo is a free operating system based on either Linux or FreeBSD that can be automatically optimized and customized for just about any application or need. Extreme configurability, performance and a top-notch user and developer community are all hallmarks of the Gentoo experience.

# About this image

Since Gentoo is a rolling release distribution, the `jgkim/gentoo-base:latest` tag will always point the most recently built image. This image lacks build tools such as GCC, Binutils, Libtool, Autotools, etc. Thus, binary packages can only be emerged with this image.

# Supported Docker versions

This image is officially supported on Docker version 1.6.2.

Support for older versions (down to 1.0) is provided on a best-effort basis.
